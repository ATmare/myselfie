## A Hybrid Symbolic Execution and Bounded Model Checking Engine in Selfie by Christian Edelmayer, University of Salzburg, Austria, 2019 ([PDF](bachelor_thesis_edelmayer.pdf), [Code](https://github.com/cksystemsteaching/selfie/tree/bachelor_thesis_edelmayer))

In a world dependent on software, it is of the utmost importance to ensure the correctness of that software. For this reason, software needs to be analyzed. In this thesis, the software analysis methods called symbolic execution and bounded model checking are explained in detail. Furthermore, a hybrid symbolic execution and bounded model checking engine was implemented in Selfie. It is outlined thoroughly how the symbolic execution engine was extended into the hybrid engine. The main challenge was to implement the merging of paths which corresponds to bounded model checking. Our experiments show that symbolic execution produces formulas which can be solved more easily at the cost of a slower translation time. Exactly the opposite is true for bounded model checking. In other words, both methods have their advantages and disadvantages.


## Selfie - RISC-V to x86-64 Binary Translation, University of Salzburg, Austria, 2020 ([PDF](bachelor_thesis_kollert.pdf), [Code](https://github.com/cksystemsteaching/selfie/tree/RISC-V-to-x86))

In this work I present an implementation of a binary translator that statically translates RISC-V machine code produced by starc into x86-64 machine code. The requirements are that the binary translator should be able to translate Selfie itself and the usage of a minimal subset of x86-64 instructions. As it is in the nature of Selfie the implementation should also be as minimal as possible. There are a few challenges to overcome to make this work. First the x86-64 ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) is an variable length instruction set which makes calculation of target addresses of jump instructions more difficult. Further the x86-64 instruction set mostly consists of two-operator instructions and even some single-operator instructions in contrast to three-operator instructions in RISC-V. And last but not least we will see that for some RISC-V instructions it is not possible to make an translation entirely without context. The result is a binary translator that is able to generate an x86-64 selfie binary with functioning self-compilation in x86-64. The difference with the translated binary is that there is no longer a need to link against a library, since it uses its own implemantations for the library routines.
