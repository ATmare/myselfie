// The trampoline must be mapped at the same vaddr for both the kernel and

// According to the Sv39 documentation, the vaddr "must have bits 63â€“39 all equal to bit 38, or else a page-fault

// The kernel's stack is mapped into virtual address space's higher half in its own address space
// as well as all userspace processes (but not accessible to those)
// This is required so that our trap handler can access the kernel stack easily.
// Due to descending full stack semantics, we need to point sp one element above the actual first stack slot
#define STACK_VADDR TRAMPOLINE_VADDR

// The top-most stack address for a user process.
// As specified by the RISC-V ELF psABI (https://github.com/riscv/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.md),
// we use a descending full stack, i.e. sp points to the last pushed element in the stack
// Thus, USERSPACE_STACK_START shall be positioned one above the actual first stack slot.
// To have a clean separation between userspace and kernel-in-userspace pages, userspace pages
// will be placed in the lower 256 GiB range (bit 38 always cleared).
